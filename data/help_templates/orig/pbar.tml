Stats

This is the second tab of the miniwindow

It shows some city wide statistics and their recent development.

A bar on the right side indicates an increase. A bar on the left side indicates a decrease. The size of the bar indicates the amount of change. Good changes are green bad ones red. But beaware that too much of a good thing is not always good.

Use the scroll up and down buttons to see different bars.
