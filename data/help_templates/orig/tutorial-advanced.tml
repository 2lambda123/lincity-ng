Advanced features

SUBH: Markets and Transports

Double click on a market in the main screen opens a windows. This is to control the <b> exchanges between markets and transports</b>.

* buy is what the market buys from the transport (so market stock will increase)
* sell is the opposite.

This feature is rarely used, except when you want to precisely prevent something to happen.

SUBH: Sustainable development

The fourth tab of the miniwindow shows progress bars for sustainable development.

It is strongly recommended to save the game before you let it run for a long time and see if you have reached a sustainable state. If something goes very wrong (starvation for example) you can restart from the saved gameÂ :-)

Watching at the total markets stocks (the miniwindow with progress bars) should prevent big troubles. From time to time check the sustainable progression in the ECO miniwindow should be enough.

* Hint: Beware of shanties and wastes in markets...
