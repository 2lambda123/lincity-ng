Waste

Waste is produced whenever goods are consumed. It may be put to a landfill, processed at recycle centres or
simply pile up on transport and markets. However, if to much waste piles up it catches fire and causes heavy air pollution.

Electricified farms and forests (aka communes) can bio-degrade a little waste.
