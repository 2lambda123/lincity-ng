Fast speed

IMG_1[]: images/gui/speed/faster.png

This is the fast speed button. It causes the game to run as fast as possible. Care should be taken when using fast mode on fast machines; 'situations' can develop very quickly!

The command line option "-q 1" or "--quick 1" will give the fastest possible speed (less than 10s par year), but can heat your hardware. Default is -q 9 (near 25s per year). This option has no effect on other game speed.
