University

Universities help to increase your technology level.
In the process they consume goods and jobs. They produce more than schools for a given goods/jobs input.
However they cunsume a lot of goods and jobs and also cost quite a lot of money to run, so you should
have the economic and industrial capacity to supply them.

You will need a number of universities to achieve a tech level close to 100%

Universities do not need to be connected to transport; they can get all their
requirements from markets within range and with enough jobs and goods available.

SUBH: NOTE

You must have 4 schools per university to supply them with students.
